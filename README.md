Vicky is a prototype algorithm that accepts:

* a video (preferably a short video with several scene changes, e.g. GoPro video)
* a song

In a nutshell, it analyzes the beat structure of the song and the onset times of scene changes in the video in order to sync the video up with the song. Based on the beat of the song, it either slightly shortens or lengthens the scenes of the video so that they change in beat with the music.
